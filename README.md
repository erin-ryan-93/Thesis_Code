# Thesis_Code
Run an experiment to gather behavioral and physiological data as people interact with social media content.


This code is designed to present participants in a research experiment with content taken from social media, and interface with Biopac/AcqKnowledge physiological data acquisition systems.
This code records the timestamps, responses, item category, and item ID for the presentation of each stimuli, and sends a stimuli presentation marker to AcqKnowledge Software. 
hbrexperiment_ready code is designed to be used with a DAQ serialport emulator, and Biopac MP 150 system/AcqKnowledge 4 systems.
hbr2_ready_labformat has been developed for use with with BlackBox systems serial port adaptors, AcqKnowledge 5, and Biopac MP 160 systems.
This code is designed to be run on Windows 7, and Matlab 2019a. 

You will need to instal PsychToolbox and MapleLab CogToolbox to use this code, both of which are freely available.
You will need to adjust the Screen measurements/ text placement based on the physical size of the screen on the computer. It is not one size fits all.

This code officially belongs to USC, where it was developed, and cannot be used for profit.
